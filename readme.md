Forked from https://github.com/wesnolte/jOrgChart

I created this project to help my colleagues get to know each other better. Have you ever heard: "But who the f*** is this person who has just called me?!"

My database is obviously not publicly available.
Therefore, if you want to create a flowchart, **I recommend you to consult the original project**:

Please, see [this GitHub](https://github.com/wesnolte/jOrgChart) for more informations about jOrgChart
